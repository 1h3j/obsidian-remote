	- God's Name
		- In the Old Testament: Yahweh
		- In the New Testament: Father, Son, and Holy Spirit
	- Titles of God
		- God's name indicates his nature; while God's titles refer to his activity:
			- Adonai - Master of the Universe
			- Elohim - Lord of Power and Might
			- Sabaoth - Lord of the Heavenly Armies
			- El Shaddai - The Provider
	- The name "Yahweh" was so holy that it could be pronounced only by the High Priest once a year, on the Day of Atonement.
	- When pronouncing Yahweh, the Israelites has to pronounce the title Adonai instead when pronouncing Yahweh in prayers or Scripture readings
	- The word Jehovah is a pseudonym obtained by intersecting the consonants of the name, Yahweh (YHWH), with the vowels of the title Adonai (AOA), this way, when the readers would come across the fictitious name Yahowah, they would be reminded to pronounce Adonai and not Yahweh.
