Whenever students knock on the high school faculty door to look for a specific teacher, it often disturbs others. This research addresses that issue by developing the TNS (Teacher Notifier System), which consists of three main components: the notifier, the app, and the notification display. Key features include an availability checker, teacher notifier, notification display, and response system. This system aims to reduce disruptions and improve communication between students and teachers.
