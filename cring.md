I have a lot of words to say but I don't want to bother you anymore. I'm too tired and I feel like everyone is too. Maybe I'm actually too sensitive and slight tiredness is more than enough to knock me out. I think I should consider about others too. What I've learned about this day is that I'm not an island. Sure, I've heard of the phrase more times than I can count. But this is the first time I've put the phrase to heart. I was honestly very committed to actually **doing it**. I've planned to buy some beer and bread; a reference to the last supper lol. I'd probably go to straight to hell because suicide. haha. But pretty fitting for my religion, I'd be Judas lol. But everything aside, I'm sorry if I'm.. this. I hope you don't get too worried. I'm fine. I hope you great success in whatever thing. I hope I'm not in your way of things. You don't look affected by it anyways. But still hoping. I think I'll find greater success in improvement by myself than with others. After all, I'm me and I'm the one that should be taking care of myself. Thank you for everything.
