# Why do I need a job?
> I need money
# What do I need money for?
> I need so I can have more allowance, giving me room to spend it on important stuff
# What are those important stuff?
> Like projects, sometimes it doesn't have to be important like funds for outing, so I can socialize every now and then.
# What about other stuff?
> Savings (and maybe investments), Personal budget, food.
# How much money would I need to be able to achieve the things I've mentioned?
> 15k-30k is enough if I want to still live with my parents, but if I want to go independent, I would have to up it to 30k-40k.
# If I did actually go independent, would I be comfortable living in 30-40k?
> Estimated bills would be around 15-20k, so I would have 10-20k left, which is more than enough. (~5k/week avg) 
# What jobs would get me to 15-20k?
