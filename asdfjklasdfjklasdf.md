probably the worst person to tell but I think there;s something with Tiffany. i know it might just be na pagod sya, and i do understand it. Araw-araw ako pagod, at gusto ko parin sumiksik ng mga iba pa (my desparation for money). Maybe she's being going through something or maybe she's had enough bullshit. Pag pagod ako, sabog utak ko, pero mostly di masyado halata because some people might just call it "my personaly". I'm not the same person that you see, as the what I potentially can be. I am also tired of this bullsit and I just went all out last week.
