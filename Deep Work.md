# Deep Work
Cal Newport
# Method 1: Be *very* selective about your work environments
- Find the best place to work. One with the least amount of distractions. Luxurious workplaces work better because of the fact that you've spent money on it and you want to make your money worth.
- Also find a place that relates with what work you're doing. This allows you to have your creativity to flow more smoothly.

# Method 2: Your time boxes has to be made of cast iron
> *"Distractions are okay; just have a schedule for them"* -Cal Newport
- The deep work time
- You can start scheduling a [[Time Box]] for **30 minutes** *(pomodoro technique)* and work your way up to **2-3 hours**.
- A time box is like putting a physical barrier around you that prevents distractions from getting in.
- Some distractions might still pass through by YOU yourself creating a hole. By fighting against those distractions, your brain reconstructs that wall with stronger materials and reinforces yourself to stop yourself from creating more holes.

# Method 3: Don't plan your day like a fool
## i) Schedule your day in batches of similar tasks
- Your brain wastes a lot of energy switching between very different tasks.
- Make it feel like the batches of similar tasks are one whole task.
## ii) Schedule your deep work as early in the day as possible
- You have more brain power right after waking up.
## iii) Schedule buffer/contingency for flexibility
- You're not sure if you're actually going to finish a task at exactly a given time. *(Mistakes and technical issues happen and can ruin your schedule, and make you panic even more!)*
- **15-30min** buffers are recommended

# Method 4: Create a ritual before you enter deep work
- Allows you to control your deep work state by having it always go off after a specific ritual.
- The ritual reinforces information to your sub-conscious brain, that you should go in a deep work state right after the ritual.
- Any ritual works, the important thing is reinforcement.

# Method 5: Use idle-gaps like a smart person
> *"Once you're wired for distraction, you crave it."* -Cal Newport
- Practice ***patience*** and handling moments of boredom, without doing a stimulating activity.
- Become comfortable with peace and quiet.
- If you're not able to stand boredom, your brain panics in a situation in times of solving a hard problem and finds a stimulating activity to cope with stress that is being induced by the workload.

# Method 6: Multi-task the right way, not the wrong way
- Take advantage of tasks you already do *(and doesn't take that much cognitive power)* and use it to deeply think of a creative problem you need to solve (Brain training)
- At the first few times you do this, you might think of less important and entertaining thoughts. If you do think of these, you can just set these aside for later, and come back to your main tasks.
- Structure your thinking process, and think of key questions one at a time, then summarize your conclusions, at the end of your thinking sessions.

# Method 7: You should become less responsible
> *"Clarity about what matters, provides clarity about what does not."* -Cal Newport
- Don't take too much responsibilities

# Method 8: Avoid the "Any Benefit" mind trap
- Your brain loves doing low productivity tasks that benefit you next to none, despite knowing it's a waste of time. It does that by rationalizing the benefits that you should it.
- Don't be too FOMO
- Identify the highest priority task, and go for the highest priority first.

# Method 9: End your day the right way, not the wrong way
- Allow your brain to relax in the evening, with no work in mind.
- Having a lot of things in mind stresses your mind and makes it much harder for your brain to rest.
- Spend the last 15 minutes of your work day listing out all the urgent and important items in your TODO list, and write a plan on how you are going to tackle and handle each one of them tomorrow.

# Method 10: Relax the right way, not the wrong way
- Your brain does not tire out the same way as your muscles, it feels that way because of your habits.
- Instead do things that are fun and adventurous, and something you can actually benefit from.
